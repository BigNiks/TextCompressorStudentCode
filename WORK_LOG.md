| Nov 24 |     8-9 AM     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I spent most of this time brainstorming solutions to this problem. Some things I thought of included finding words that rhyme, repeated words, punctuation, and also even repeated chars. I am thinking of different ways to be able to determine each one but still haven't fully committed to one approach. |

Mr. Blick suggested to us to try this approach for now and it makes sense. I am currently planning out a small test array of common english words and assigning them each a specific 8 bit code. I think I am planning on making two seperate arrays, one for the words and one for the binary correlating to that specific word. |
| Dec 4  |  5:30-6:30 PM  |                                                       I spent this time continuing to code out the pseudo code mentioned before. The code feels a little janky but I have made an attempt to the best of my abilities. I ran into some problems in expand because of my chosen bit length, I am not sure if it will properly read out the designated codes. For my compress, I thought to make the loop check if the beginning letter length up to the next space char was the same as one of the words saved in the array. If it was, then it would write out the designated code rather than the word itself. |
| Dec 6  |     2-3 PM     | I spent this time reviewing the concept of LZW and pseudo coding my interpretation of this algorithm. I understand that I first must write out the extended ASCII table within my tst for compress. After that I will get the longest prefix and write it out in my compressed file, after that I will check that the next character in my encrypted string is not out of bounds and add it to my prefix. As for my expand algorithm, I will create a map of strings and add the initial 255 characters to it, after that I will grab the first code and make that equal to my current prefix and write it out. |

It went pretty smoothly with no major roadblocks, except for trying to get the new prefix coded out, which was a little trick but I ended up figuring it out. |

I had trouble trying to figure out my map size as well as trying to work around that tricky edge case. Not only that, but also trying to successfully grab that look ahead string and code. |
