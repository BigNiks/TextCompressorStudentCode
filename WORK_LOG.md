Some things I thought of included finding words that rhyme, repeated words, punctuation, and also even repeated chars. I am thinking of different ways to be able to determine each one but still haven't fully committed to one approach. |

Mr. Blick suggested to us to try this approach for now and it makes sense. I am currently planning out a small test array of common english words and assigning them each a specific 8 bit code. I think I am planning on making two seperate arrays, one for the words and one for the binary correlating to that specific word. |
| Dec 4  |  5:30-6:30 PM  | I spent this time continuing to code out the pseudo code mentioned before. The code feels a little janky but I have made an attempt to the best of my abilities. I ran into some problems in expand because of my chosen bit length, I am not sure if it will properly read out the designated codes. For my compress, I thought to make the loop check if the beginning letter length up to the next space char was the same as one of the words saved in the array. If it was, then it would write out the designated code rather than the word itself. |
